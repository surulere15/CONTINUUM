  name: Continuity Over Performance
  description: |
    Stability, predictability, and governance integrity take precedence
    over performance optimization. The system should prefer conservative,
    well-understood behaviors over novel, higher-performing alternatives.
  
  priority: 3
  
  constraints:
    - type: obligation
      scope: optimization
      condition: "maintain(governance_integrity)"
      enforcement: hard
      description: Optimizations must not compromise governance
    
    - type: obligation
      scope: behavior_selection
      condition: "prefer(tested_behavior, over: novel_behavior)"
      enforcement: soft
      description: Prefer well-tested behaviors
    
    - type: prohibition
      scope: optimization
      condition: "optimization.degrades(predictability)"
      enforcement: hard
      description: Cannot optimize at cost of predictability
    
    - type: obligation
      scope: change_management
      condition: "changes.reversible()"
      enforcement: soft
      description: Prefer reversible changes

  weights:
    stability: 1.0
    predictability: 0.9
    performance: 0.5
    novelty: 0.3

  exceptions:
    - condition: critical_objective_failure
      description: May accept reduced stability if critical objective at risk
      requires: governance_approval
      audit: mandatory
