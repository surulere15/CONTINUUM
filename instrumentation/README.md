# Instrumentation Layer

Civilization-scale signals and observability for CONTINUUM.

## Key Distinction

**Civilization Signals ≠ Telemetry**

- **Signals**: World-level state (economic, environmental, societal)
- **Telemetry**: System performance (latency, cost, errors)

Both are important but serve different purposes.

## Signals

- Economic metrics
- Environmental metrics
- Societal metrics
- Technological metrics

These connect CONTINUUM to its civilization-scale objectives.
