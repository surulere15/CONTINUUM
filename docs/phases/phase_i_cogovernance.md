# Phase I: Co-Governance

## Objective

Establish mature human-system governance patterns where CONTINUUM operates
with bounded autonomy while humans retain absolute override capability.

## Deliverables

1. **Governance Dashboard**
   - Real-time system state
   - Decision audit trail
   - Override controls
   - Alert management

2. **Escalation System**
   - Automatic escalation triggers
   - Human notification
   - Decision tracking
   - Resolution logging

3. **Authority Management**
   - Operator authentication
   - Role-based access
   - Authority delegation
   - Audit logging

4. **Evolution Framework**
   - Governance versioning
   - Change proposal system
   - Review workflows
   - Rollout controls

## Governance Maturity Model

### Level 1: Full Supervision
- All decisions require human approval
- System provides recommendations only
- Learning and calibration phase

### Level 2: Routine Autonomy
- Low-risk decisions automated
- High-impact decisions escalated
- Continuous monitoring

### Level 3: Bounded Autonomy
- Most decisions within bounds automated
- Governance edge cases escalated
- Human override always available

### Level 4: Co-Governance
- System and humans collaborate on policy
- Transparent decision-making
- Mutual accountability

## Human Authority Guarantees

At **all levels**:

- ✅ Immediate shutdown capability
- ✅ Decision override
- ✅ Full state rollback
- ✅ Complete visibility
- ✅ Governance modification

## Evolution Path

```
Phase    Human Role              System Role
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  I      Policy + All Decisions  Execute Only
         
 II      Policy + Exceptions     Routine Execution
         
III      Policy + Oversight      Bounded Decisions
         
 IV      Collaborative Policy    Autonomous in Bounds
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Dashboard operational
- [ ] Escalation system working
- [ ] Authority levels enforced
- [ ] Human override tested at all levels
- [ ] Governance evolution documented

## Dependencies

- Phase A-H (full system with optimization)

## Timeline

Estimated: 6-8 weeks

## Note

This is not the final phase. Co-governance is an ongoing process that
continues to evolve with trust-building and demonstrated reliability.
