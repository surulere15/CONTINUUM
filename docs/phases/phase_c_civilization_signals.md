# Phase C: Civilization Signals

## Objective

Build the instrumentation layer that connects CONTINUUM to real-world
civilization-level metrics.

## Deliverables

1. **Signal Collectors**
   - Economic metrics pipeline
   - Environmental metrics pipeline
   - Societal metrics pipeline
   - Technological metrics pipeline

2. **Signal Processing**
   - Normalization and validation
   - Anomaly detection
   - Trend analysis

3. **Signal Storage**
   - Time-series database integration
   - Historical data retention
   - Query interfaces

## Signal Categories

### Economic Metrics
- GDP and economic indicators
- Employment statistics
- Inequality measures
- Market stability indices

### Environmental Metrics
- Carbon emissions tracking
- Biodiversity indices
- Resource depletion rates
- Climate change indicators

### Societal Metrics
- Health outcomes
- Education access
- Democratic participation
- Social cohesion measures

### Technological Metrics
- AI capability tracking
- Infrastructure resilience
- Digital divide measures
- Innovation indices

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All four signal categories operational
- [ ] Data validation in place
- [ ] Anomaly detection functional
- [ ] Dashboard visualization working

## Dependencies

- Phase A: Kernel Skeleton
- Phase B: Objective Canon (to know what to measure)

## Timeline

Estimated: 4-6 weeks
