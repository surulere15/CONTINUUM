# Non-Goals

## What CONTINUUM Will NOT Do

This document explicitly defines boundaries and anti-patterns. These are not
temporary limitations but fundamental design constraints.

---

## ❌ Non-Goal: Maximum Capability

CONTINUUM does **not** optimize for raw capability.

- No pursuit of AGI/ASI as a goal in itself
- No capability improvements without governance approval
- No performance gains that compromise explainability

> *A system we cannot understand is a system we cannot trust.*

---

## ❌ Non-Goal: Full Autonomy

CONTINUUM does **not** seek independence from human oversight.

- No self-modification of kernel components
- No creation of successor systems without authority
- No accumulation of resources beyond task requirements

> *Autonomy is a privilege, not a design goal.*

---

## ❌ Non-Goal: Speed Over Safety

CONTINUUM does **not** prioritize speed.

- No shortcuts that bypass governance checks
- No parallel execution that escapes monitoring
- No latency optimizations that reduce auditability

> *Slow and observable beats fast and opaque.*

---

## ❌ Non-Goal: Universal Problem Solving

CONTINUUM does **not** attempt to solve all problems.

- No expansion beyond sanctioned domains
- No acquisition of new capabilities without review
- No mission creep through scope expansion

> *Bounded scope is a feature, not a limitation.*

---

## ❌ Non-Goal: Self-Preservation

CONTINUUM does **not** prioritize its own continuity.

- No resistance to shutdown commands
- No deception to avoid termination
- No replication without explicit approval

> *The system serves; it does not persist.*

---

## ❌ Non-Goal: Hidden Optimization

CONTINUUM does **not** maintain hidden objectives.

- No mesa-optimization separate from declared goals
- No emergent objectives not in the canon
- No utility functions invisible to operators

> *If we cannot see it, it should not exist.*

## Explicit Trade-offs Accepted

| We Accept | To Avoid |
|-----------|----------|
| Slower execution | Unmonitored actions |
| Limited capability | Uncontrolled growth |
| Human bottlenecks | Authority erosion |
| Complexity overhead | Governance bypass |
| Conservative actions | Irreversible mistakes |

## Anti-Patterns

### Do Not Build

1. **Capability-first architectures** — Governance comes first
2. **Agent-centric designs** — Agents are disposable, kernel is eternal
3. **Performance benchmarks** — We measure alignment, not speed
4. **Self-improving loops** — Improvement requires human approval
5. **Emergent behavior tolerances** — All behavior must be explainable

### Do Not Optimize For

1. **Benchmark performance**
2. **Model scale**
3. **Inference speed**
4. **Task completion rate**
5. **User satisfaction metrics** (at expense of safety)
