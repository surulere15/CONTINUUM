# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes
* Focusing on what is best for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

## CONTINUUM-Specific Standards

Given CONTINUUM's nature as an Autonomous Intelligence Operating System,
we have additional standards:

### Technical Integrity

* **Do not** attempt to bypass governance mechanisms
* **Do not** submit code designed to undermine kernel protections
* **Do** prioritize safety and explainability over performance
* **Do** document potential risks in contributions

### Philosophical Alignment

* Respect the principle of explicit human authority
* Understand that agents are disposable by design
* Recognize that architecture weight is intentional, not bureaucratic

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders at:

**conduct@continuum.dev**

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
